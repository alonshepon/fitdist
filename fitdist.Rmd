# Motivating Example

## Motivating Example

What is the contribution of current red meat consumption levels to the colorectal cancer disease burden?

## Motivating Example

What is the contribution of current red meat consumption levels to the colorectal cancer disease burden?

**Comparative Risk Assessment**

Systematic evaluation of the changes in burden of disease which would result from modifying the population distribution of exposure to a **theoretical minimum risk exposure distribution (TMRED)** that would imply minimum health loss, keeping all other risk factors unchanged

Calculation of **Population Attributable Fraction**

$$PAF=\frac{\int{P(x)RR(x)dx}-\int{P'(x)RR(x)dx}}{\int{P(x)RR(x)dx}}$$

## Motivating Example

What is the contribution of current red meat consumption levels to the colorectal cancer disease burden?

**Comparative Risk Assessment**

Systematic evaluation of the changes in burden of disease which would result from modifying the population distribution of exposure to a **theoretical minimum risk exposure distribution (TMRED)** that would imply minimum health loss, keeping all other risk factors unchanged

Calculation of **Attributable Burden**

$$AB=B*PAF$$


## Motivating Example

What is the contribution of current red meat consumption levels to the colorectal cancer disease burden?

**Data requirements**

- Current disease burden of colorectal cancer
- Relative risk function
- Current red meat consumption levels
- Ideal consumption level (TMREL)

## Which distribution?

Main characteristic: non-negative, continuous

```{r plotdist}
## plot distributions with same mean and SD
m <- 200
s <- 100
v <- s^2
b_gamma <- m/v
a_gamma <- m*b_gamma
a_lnorm <- log(m)-0.5*log((s/m)^2+1)
b_lnorm <- sqrt(log((s/m)^2+1))
a_weibull <- (s/m)^-1.086
b_weibull <- m / gamma(1+1/a_weibull)

par(mar = c(2, 4, 0, 0))
curve(dgamma(x, a_gamma, b_gamma),
      to = 800,
      col = "red",
      lwd = 2,
      xlab = NA,
      ylab = "density",
      ylim = c(0, 0.0055))
curve(dlnorm(x, a_lnorm, b_lnorm),
      add = TRUE,
      col = "blue",
      lwd = 2)
curve(dweibull(x, a_weibull, b_weibull),
      add = TRUE,
      col = "green",
      lwd = 2)
legend("topright",
       legend = c("Gamma", "Log-normal", "Weibull"),
       col = c("red", "blue", "green"),
       lty = 1)
```

## Which distribution? | Excessive zeros

Mixture of Bernoulli process (0/1) and exposure distribution

<br>

**Zero-inflated models**

- Zeros may arise from Bernoulli process or exposure distribution
- Zeros modelled as "true" and "apparent" zeros

**Hurdle models**

- Zeros only arise from Bernoulli process
- Zeros and non-zeros modelled as two separate processes


## Which distribution? | Excessive zeros

```{r hurdle}
y <- rgamma(8e5, a_gamma, b_gamma)
y <- c(rep(0, 2e5), y)

par(mar = c(2, 4, 0, 0))
plot(density(y, from = 0),
     col = "red",
     lwd = 2,
     main = NA,
     xlab = NA,
     xlim = c(0, 800))
legend("topright",
       legend = "Bernoulli-Gamma",
       col = "red",
       lty = 1)
```

# Individual observations

## Individual observations | Import data

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
#dta <- read.csv("consumption.csv")
dta <- rpois(250, 250)
```

## Individual observations | Histogram

```{r hist}
hist(dta)
```

## Individual observations | Bootstrap

## Individual observations | Method of moments

## Individual observations | Maximum likelihood

# Quantiles
